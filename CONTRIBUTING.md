## Mixie Architecture

* All of Mixie's code has been written into one single file.  
  While I agree that this is a bad coding practice, I want it to be portable  
  A single file for the program and another one for the data is the cleanest thing I can think of  

* The `Mixie` class handles all logic for processing data and taking the necassary actions.
