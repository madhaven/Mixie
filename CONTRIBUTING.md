## Some Background

The mixie project is basically a script that helps you load songs into a music player (VLC for now).  
Songs in the library are indexed with a tag that the user assigns.  
The user could therefore call Mixie with different tags to include and avoid and Mixie would fetch the songs accordingly.  
The tags and files are saved in plain text.
